# Hello Star Wars

Hello Star Wars is a two week paired project for Front End Engineering students in Module 3 at the Turing School of Software & Design. Students learn how to set up multiple fetch calls to a Star Wars data api, manage the chain of returned promise objects, and use the resulting data in a React web app. No comp is provided; all design elements were created by the team, from scratch, using Adobe Illustrator. The authors selected a Star Wars / Hello Kitty crossover theme.

Hello Star Wars, also known as 'Swapi-Box', is the first project in Module 2 to test changes to state, React Router, ASYNC functionality, propTypes and JSX snapshots.

This project was built with the create-react-app starter kit. All tests are executed by Jest and Enzyme. The project challenges students to follow Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, and Single Responsibility principles.
